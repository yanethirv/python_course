Your first program
You will use a Jupyter notebook to create your first program. Your senior officer wants you to create code to perform a couple of utilities. You will start by displaying today's date. Then you will add code to convert parsecs to lightyears.
This exercise is broken into a series of steps. For each step you will be presented with the goal for the step, followed by an empty cell. Enter your Python into the cell and run it. The solution for each step will follow each cell.
"""

"""
Display today's date
In the cell below, add the code to display today's date. Remember you can use the date object from the datetime library to access calendar information.
"""

from datetime import date

print(date.today())

"""
Build a unit converter
Now it's time to turn your attention to the second utility, converting parsecs to lightyears. One parsec is 3.26 lightyears, so you will multiply parsecs by that value to determine lightyears.
Create a variable named parsecs and set it to 11. Then add the code to perform the appropriate calculation and store the result in a variable named lightyears. Finally print the result on the screen with so it displays a message which resembles the following:

11 parsecs is ___ lightyears

Remember to you can use str to convert numbers to strings
"""
parsecs = 11
lightyears = parsecs * 3.26
print(str(parsecs) + " parsecs is " + str(lightyears) + " lightyears")
